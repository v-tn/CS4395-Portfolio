# Overview of NLP
This is a pdf document that shows an overview of NLP. You can see the [pdf document here](Overview_Of_NLP.pdf).

# Program 1
Program 1 is a program that reads a csv file comtaining employees id, first name, last name, middle initial, and phone number and processes it. The program should fix any mistake in the data and display the results. You can see program 1 [here](hw1_vtn180000.py). To run it, you need a csv file name "data.csv" inside a folder named data. Furthermore, you need to make sure the file path is in sysarg. There are some strengths for text processing in Python. The first is that it is easy to edit lines. You can split the lines up after reading in lines from the file. Also, you can lower case and capitalize letters in lines. 

I realized I learned a lot after writing program 1. Before, I never had experience with writing Python. Now, I know how to read a file in Python. Furthermore, I now know how to edit letters and lines in Python.

# Program 2
Program 2 reads the file contents and tokenizes the file contents. The program outputs unique lemmas, calculates lexical diversity, count nouns in the file, and does other things as well. The program is also a word guessing game. You can see program 2 [here](hw2_vtn180000.py).

# WordNet
This is a pdf document that shows an overview of WordNet, SentiWordNet, Morphy, and Collocation. You can see the [pdf document here](wordnet.pdf).

# N-Gram Language Model Program and Report
There are two programs for the N-Gram. [This](hw3_vtn180000_program_1.py) is the first program. The first program reads in a csv file and then tokenizes the text. After that, the program creates a bigram and unigram list. Lastly, the program creates two dictionary from the two lists and then pickles them. The [second program](hw3_vtn180000_program_2.py) reads in the pickles from the first program and unpickles them. The (N-Gram report)[vtn180000.N-Grams.pdf] is a pdf document that talks about N-Grams, describing what they are and how are they important.
